# Integrated Project#3 - Angular Oscillations of the Rigid Body

Project files for the third integrated project of the COMA Capsule at Abdullah Gül University, Fall 2023.

This report investigates the torsional oscillations of a cylinder cup suspended on an elastic string. We determined the moment of inertia, torsion modulus, and checked the conservation of energy based on experimental measurements.

This project consists of 3 parts:

1. **MATH153 & PHYS105**: Theoretical and experimental calculations of torsional oscillations of a cylinder cup suspended on an elastic string.
2. **MATH103**: Mathematical modeling of the pendulum motion using matrices and vectors.
3. **EE101**: Gives information about an ideal pendulum.

Code for EE101 part: <https://gist.github.com/barbarbar338/4954c7a930df8059dd4aaad198a93383>

**NOTE:** Please note that the calculations on the report may not be accurate, as the project was done in my freshman year and I was not very familiar with the concepts at that time. I want to keep this project as a reference for my future self and for anyone who may find it useful.
