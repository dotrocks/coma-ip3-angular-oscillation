\chapter{Conclusion}

In conclusion, this experiment successfully determined the moment of inertia and torsion modulus of a cylindrical cup, while also confirming the energy is not conserved in the system because of the potential forces. Potential improvements include refining measurements, considering damping effects and friction. The results provide valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of torsional oscillations.

\section*{Further Studies}

Future experiments could investigate the influence of different suspension materials and lengths on the oscillation frequency and damping. Additionally, exploring the torsional behavior of non-cylindrical shapes could provide further insights into the relationship between geometry and torsional properties.
